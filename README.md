Various time series data mining techniques will be implemented, tested, and visualized.

### Perceptually Important Points (PIPs)
The PIPs method is a dimensionality reduction technique for time series data. It represents a time series with its n most noticeable points. The PIPs algorithm is implemented in `ts_pips.py`, and in `ts_pips_testing.ipynb`, it is tested and visualized. More on the PIPs method and other techniques will follow. \
